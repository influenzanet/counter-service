# Counter service

Tiny service to fetch aggregated statistics from participants 

The goal of this service is to propose a standardized way to fetch active participants counter to enable counter federation (like legacy Influenzanet website).
This service handles counter for **one instance** but several studies can be fetched using the same service instance.

> [!CAUTION]
> This service is not ready to be used in production. It's not stable yet. Any part of this service is susceptible to change without compatibility with previous It should be released in start of year 2024. 

## Handled metrics (for each study)

- participants_enrolled (*count*): Count of participants of the study with active status
- participants_active (*count*): Count of participants of the study with at least one survey submitted in the sufvey list during the delay

The type of each the counter is provided between parenthesis see below for types

## Usage

The server is loaded by default on :5021 port

Endpoints :

### $baseURI/

Status page, just to say hello.

### $baseURI/whoami

Fetch the service meta data

```json
{
studies: [
    "grippenet"
],
influenzanet: "",
from: "2022-11-22T00:00:00Z"
}
```

`studies`: list of studies for which a counter is available
`influenzanet`: name of the influenzanet compliant study if it's not 'influenzanet'
`from`: `FROM_DATE` value

### $baseURI/study/`$study`

Fetch stats for the provided study key (replace `$study` by the study key name)

Response: an array of Counter results

Each Counter has 4 possible fields: 

- name: counter name
- value: object value (depend on type see below)
- type: 'count' or 'map'
- time: time field when the counter has been evaluated for the last time

value field is 
- a number if type is 'count'
- an object (key value pair) if type is 'map'

Example

```json
[
    {
        "name": "simple_counter",
        "type": "count",
        "value": 9911
    },
    {
        "name": "map_counter",
        "type": "map",
        "value": {
                "1": 292,
                "2": 861,
                "3": 934,
                "4": 938,
                "5": 928,
                "6": 620
        }
    }
]
```

## Configuration

Environments:

- Db Connection vars: see in [Study Service](https://github.com/grippenet/study-service/blob/master/build/docker/example/study-service-env.list), accept User Db variables and general db client settings

- `STUDIES`: comma separated list of studies
- `INSTANCE_ID` instance id of the target instance of the platform
- `FROM_DATE`: Date (ISO format YYYY-MM-DD) from which count intake submissions
- `UPDATE_DELAY`: Delay in Minutes to update the counter internally
- `INFLUENZANET_STUDY`: Name of the Influenzanet compliant study 

To configure Http Server:

- `PORT`: change the listening port
- `GIN_MODE`: can be configured ('release' will be less verbose)
